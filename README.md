- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jarmstrong413
- I'm a computer engineering graduate from Purdue University.
- I'm looking to collaborate on or start some personal projects to become more proficient in full-stack development.
- Smaller passion projects include some low-level programmming which will be updated here soon.
